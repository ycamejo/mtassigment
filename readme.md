# MedThink Developer Interview Project
This Project uses our internal boilerplate for most digital projects.


### Stack
Our typical stack consists of:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html)
- [Scss](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [Foundation](https://get.foundation/sites/docs/)

### Installing
- Run `npm install`
- Troubleshoot any issues.

### Instructions
Create a two page website based on the given design located in the `/public/images/example` folder. 

Note, a photo of yourself is not required and can be replaced by a pet, or favorite animal.

#### First Page
- Should include similar factoids about yourself and work well in all browser sizes. Exact design and layout is up to you. When completed please log to console your favorite TV show, Movie or Meme.

#### Second Page
- Craft a multiple choice quiz module. The format should be two truths and a lie. Using scss, pug, and javascript set up three options, two truths about yourself, and one lie. When a user clicks on an option an inline response should let them know if they got it right, or wrong. The user should be allowed to try each answer and get a different response. The style, layout, and programming technique is up to you, but should be written from scratch.

For extra points, add any additional functionality or design elements to set yourself apart from other candidates. Be creative and have fun with it!

### Turning it in
Please upload this project to github or bitbucket and provide a public link back to MedThink.

Good luck!
